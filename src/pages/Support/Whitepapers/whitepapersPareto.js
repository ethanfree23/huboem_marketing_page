            I have spent a lot of my time advising small businesses on process improvement. Most of these companies make consumer goods with a small team. They typically have a deep knowledge and passion for their product but very limited engineering experience. When I suggest the implementation of Lean or Six Sigma I am often met with (at worst) outright resistance or (at best) perplexed stares. There is an unfounded belief in many smaller organizations that Six Sigma is really only for giant companies with engineering staffs and continuous improvement teams.

          <p className="mt-6">
            One of the smaller companies I worked with gained valuable insight using Six Sigma tools. The customer is a smaller artisan candy producer in the Pacific Northwest. They were pretty much a 100% manual operation. With labor costs rising, they knew that they would need to invest in some process and packaging automation equipment to increase their output.

            The Pareto Priority Index (PPI) takes in a projectâ€™s savings, its likelihood of being successful, cost of the project, as well as its implementation time. All of these inputs are factored together like in the below formula to give you a single objective metric for comparing projects.

          <h2 className="mt-16 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900">Savings</h2>
          <p className="mt-6">
            Savings were estimated based on the labor and material savings the project would create during a five-year time window. The service life of the equipment is expected to be longer but if they achieved their sales growth targets, it would most likely be obsolete by then.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-16 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900">Probability of Success</h2>
          <p className="mt-6">
            This was estimated based on the complexity of the equipment involved in the project. Highly customized equipment means a much higher risk of late delivery, cost overruns, or other unforeseen issues.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-16 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900">Cost and Time for Completion</h2>
          <p className="mt-6">
            All costs associated with the equipment engineering, testing, installation, and support work. Time includes the lead time for equipment delivery, training, and startup time.
